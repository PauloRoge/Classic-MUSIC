# Classic-MUSIC

This repository contains the implementation of the **MUSIC (Multiple Signal Classification)** algorithm for estimating the Angle of Arrival (AoA) in MIMO systems. Classic MUSIC assumes that the number of sources is known a priori; therefore, in this project, we implemented criteria to estimate it.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Antenna Array Design: ULA.
- Scenario: Free space with Line-of-Sight.
- System: MIMO, M-MIMO.
